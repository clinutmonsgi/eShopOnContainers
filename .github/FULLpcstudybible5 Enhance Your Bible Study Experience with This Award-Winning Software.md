## What are the benefits of studying the Bible?
 
Studying the Bible is not just an intellectual exercise or a religious duty. It is a life-changing encounter with God and His Word. There are many benefits of studying the Bible that can enrich your life and transform your relationship with God. Here are some of them:

- Studying the Bible causes growth and maturity. As you feed on the pure milk of the Word, you will grow spiritually and become more like Christ (1 Pet. 2:2-3). You will also be able to discern good from evil and apply God's truth to your life (Heb. 5:11-14).
- Studying the Bible increases your knowledge of God. The Bible reveals who God is, what He has done, and what He promises to do. As you study the Bible, you will get to know God's character, attributes, and ways. You will also discover His love, grace, and mercy for you (John 17:3).
- Studying the Bible deepens your intimacy with Him. The Bible is not just a book of information, but a book of communication. God speaks to you through His Word and invites you to respond to Him in prayer and obedience. As you study the Bible, you will hear His voice, sense His presence, and enjoy His fellowship (Ps. 119:105).
- Studying the Bible gives you wisdom and understanding. The Bible is the source of all wisdom and understanding. It teaches you how to live according to God's will and how to deal with various situations and challenges in life. It also shows you how to avoid pitfalls and errors that can lead to destruction (Ps. 119:98-100).
- Studying the Bible equips you to share your faith and invest in others. The Bible is the power of God for salvation and transformation. It equips you to share the gospel with others and to defend your faith against false teachings and arguments. It also enables you to disciple others and help them grow in their walk with God (2 Tim. 3:16-17).
- Studying the Bible brings strength and guidance for life. The Bible is the sword of the Spirit that enables you to fight against the enemy and his schemes. It also gives you direction and guidance for every decision and situation in life. It shows you God's will and purpose for your life and helps you fulfill it (Eph. 6:17).

These are just some of the benefits of studying the Bible that you can experience as you devote yourself to God's Word. Studying the Bible is not a burden, but a blessing. It is not a chore, but a choice. It is not a duty, but a delight.
