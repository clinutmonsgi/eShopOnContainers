Sony Movie Studio Platinum 13 is a powerful video editing software that allows you to create professional-looking movies, slideshows, and more. However, to use the full features of the software, you need to activate it with a product key or serial number.

It is usually printed on the CD case or emailed to you after your purchase. You need to enter this code during the installation process or when prompted by the software.
