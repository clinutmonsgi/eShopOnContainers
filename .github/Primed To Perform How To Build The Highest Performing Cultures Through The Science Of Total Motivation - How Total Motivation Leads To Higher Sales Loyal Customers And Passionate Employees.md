What motivates you to do your best work? Is it money, recognition, autonomy, or something else? According to the authors of *Primed To Perform: How To Build The Highest Performing Cultures Through The Science Of Total Motivation*, there are six types of motivation that drive human behavior: play, purpose, potential, emotional pressure, economic pressure, and inertia. They call this the Total Motivation (ToMo) framework.

The book argues that the first three types of motivation are positive and intrinsic, meaning they come from within and make us enjoy our work. The last three types are negative and extrinsic, meaning they come from outside and make us feel stressed or bored. The authors claim that the higher the ratio of positive to negative motivation, the higher the performance of individuals and teams.
 
How can you use this framework to improve your team's performance? Here are some tips:
 
- Encourage play: Play is the motivation that comes from doing something for the fun of it, not for a reward or a goal. It fosters creativity, curiosity, and experimentation. To encourage play, you can give your team members autonomy to choose how they work, provide them with feedback and coaching, and create a safe environment where they can take risks and learn from failures.
- Align purpose: Purpose is the motivation that comes from doing something that matters to you or others. It fosters passion, commitment, and loyalty. To align purpose, you can help your team members understand how their work contributes to a larger mission or vision, involve them in decision-making and goal-setting, and celebrate their achievements and impact.
- Enhance potential: Potential is the motivation that comes from doing something that helps you grow or develop. It fosters learning, growth, and mastery. To enhance potential, you can provide your team members with opportunities to learn new skills, challenge them with stretch assignments, and support their career aspirations and development plans.
- Reduce emotional pressure: Emotional pressure is the motivation that comes from doing something to avoid guilt, shame, or fear. It fosters anxiety, defensiveness, and burnout. To reduce emotional pressure, you can avoid micromanaging your team members, respect their boundaries and work-life balance, and address any conflicts or issues in a constructive way.
- Minimize economic pressure: Economic pressure is the motivation that comes from doing something for a reward or to avoid a penalty. It fosters compliance, conformity, and short-term thinking. To minimize economic pressure, you can avoid using incentives or punishments as the main drivers of performance, focus on intrinsic rewards such as recognition and feedback, and align compensation with fair market value and performance.
- Eliminate inertia: Inertia is the motivation that comes from doing something because you have always done it or because you don't know what else to do. It fosters apathy, disengagement, and stagnation. To eliminate inertia, you can challenge your team members to question the status quo and suggest improvements, encourage them to explore new opportunities and possibilities, and inspire them with a compelling vision and direction.

By applying these tips, you can increase your team's total motivation and unleash their full potential. Remember that motivation is not a fixed trait but a dynamic state that can change over time and across situations. Therefore, it is important to monitor your team's motivation regularly and adjust your leadership style accordingly.
