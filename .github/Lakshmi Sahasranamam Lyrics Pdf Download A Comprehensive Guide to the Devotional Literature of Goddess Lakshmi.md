After downloading and chanting Lakshmi Sahasranamam lyrics, you may also want to perform Lakshmi Puja at home on Diwali, the festival of lights. Lakshmi Puja is a ritual that honors Goddess Lakshmi and seeks her blessings for wealth, prosperity and happiness in the new year. Here are some steps to correctly perform Lakshmi Puja at home on Diwali:

1. Tidy your house. Clean every corner of your house and sprinkle Gangajal (holy water from river Ganga) or turmeric water to purify the surroundings. Decorate your house with marigolds, mango and banana leaves, rangoli (colorful patterns made with rice flour or colored powder), diyas (oil lamps) and candles.
2. Prepare the puja altar. In your puja room or living room, spread a red cotton cloth on a table or stool and keep a handful of grains in the center. Place a kalash (silver or bronze pot) in the middle of the grains and fill it with 75% water. Put one supari (betel nut), one marigold flower, a coin and some rice grains in the kalash. Place five mango leaves on the kalash in a circular design.
3. Place idols of Lakshmi and Ganesha for puja. Place an idol or picture of Goddess Lakshmi in the center of the table and an idol or picture of Lord Ganesha on the right side (south-west direction) of the kalash. Lord Ganesha is worshipped first as he is the remover of obstacles. Place a small plate of rice in front of Goddess Lakshmi and draw a lotus flower with turmeric on the rice. Put some coins before the goddess.
4. Place accounts books or wealth related items. If you have any business or accountancy books or any other wealth or business related items, place them in front of the idols. This is to seek the blessings of Goddess Lakshmi for your work and income.
5. Apply tilak and light diyas. Apply tilak (a mark made with vermilion or sandalwood paste) to Goddess Lakshmi, Lord Ganesha and the kalash. Light diyas with oil or ghee (clarified butter) and place them around the altar.
6. Offer flowers. Offer flowers to Lord Ganesha and Goddess Lakshmi. Keep some flowers in your palm for prayer.
7. Recite puja mantra. Place flowers in your palm and join your hands in prayer mode, close your eyes and recite Diwali puja mantra. You can find the mantra online or use a book or audio guide. After prayer, offer the flowers kept in your palm to Ganesha and Lakshmi.
8. Offer water. Take a small bowl of water and sprinkle it over the idols and the kalash while reciting "Om Shri Ganeshaya Namah" for Ganesha and "Om Shri Mahalakshmyai Namah" for Lakshmi.
9. Offer mala (garland). Put haldi (turmeric), kumkum (vermilion) and rice to the idols. Place a garland of marigolds or lotuses around the necks of the idols.
10. Offer fruits and sweets. Take a coconut, supari, paan leaf (betel leaf) and offer it to the goddess along with some fruits and sweets of your choice.
11. Offer incense and camphor. Burn agarbatti (incense sticks) and shoop (camphor) in front of the idols while reciting "Aarti Shri Lakshmiji ki" (a hymn of praise for Goddess Lakshmi).

Congratulations! You have successfully performed Lakshmi Puja at home on Diwali. Now you can distribute the prasad (offering) to your family members and friends and enjoy the festival with joy and gratitude.
